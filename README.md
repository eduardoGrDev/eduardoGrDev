Our project won 1st place at the Ludic Jam 2025, secured an incubation scholarship at Tecnológico de Monterrey, and was showcased at the Game Conference MX 2025.
- **Leveling up my Tech Stack:** Currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at UACH to solidify my foundation in programming and software architecture.
- **Game Systems & QA:** Prototyping mechanics (C++, Python), analyzing player feedback, and implementing Quality Assurance (QA) processes.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
